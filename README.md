## Demo

The following is a number of gifs and images demoing the functionality of this project. Please excuse any artifacts in the gifs that is caused by the capture software used.

You may also notice that many users have the same image posted on their profile, this is a symptom of how quickly we generated our users and their posts. The Unsplash API was unable to supply a new link to an image fast enough, likely caused by caching the response from an API call.
